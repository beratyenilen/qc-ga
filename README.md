# qc-ga
We are using DEAP package to initiate and continue our evolution, and we are using ProjectQ to perform quantum computer simulations. 
Currently, we are using a set of genetic operators and selection procedure highly similar to [Potocek thing], but we allowed user to describe the topology of the quantum computer the proposed algorithms may be run on. 
We are still working on the project and we are planning to improve it further.

More details will be added later on.

TODO: Add link to paper

## Requirements

Python version: 3.9 (3.10 does not work due to numpy 1.19 requirement)

Libraries:
- libhdf5 (required by qclib)

Pip modules (defined in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)): TODO

## Usage

## Roadmap

## Contributing

## TODOS:
- Save statevector (and noisy densitymatrix) of circuit outcome
- check remove consecutive inverse gates
- create picture of ga process and data processing

## Known issues

- does not filter empty/trivial circuits and gates
- does not combine e.g. sqrtx gates
